# Sieben a.k.a. Seven
A small android application to perform the seven minutes workout.

## Project History & Maintenance

Originally written by **Gaukler Faun**. I had this app installed on my old phone, but after a recent upgrade I could no longer find it. Luckily, a few forks had been created before the original author and repository disappeared.

This version is based on those forks and has been updated to work with recent Android SDK versions, with assistance from **GitHub Copilot**. The goal of this repository is to keep the app functional and available for modern Android devices while preserving the original concept and functionality.

Please note that this repository is **not actively maintained**. I do not plan to regularly add features or provide ongoing support. That said, feel free to submit issues or pull requests—contributions are welcome—but responses and merges may be infrequent.
